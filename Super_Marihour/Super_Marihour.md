Time starts on NES bootup. Time ends upon grabbing the final star in Super Mario 64.

Each game will be started from power on as opposed to having the next game ready to go at the title screen. If using VC, a full power cycle is not required, but you must return to the Wii menu. If using Powerpak / Everdrive, Switch, or Classic, you must power cycle before starting a new game.

Your time does not have to be sub-hour in order to submit to the LB.
