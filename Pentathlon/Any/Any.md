## Timing

*Game switch and load times are excluded from the final time.*  
Use the timing indication below to remove all load times and game switch and submit it in the **without loads**. If you're unsure, put the total time in **with loads** and moderators will retime the run.

We allow a maximum of 1 minute between games. All exceeding time will be part of your final time.
