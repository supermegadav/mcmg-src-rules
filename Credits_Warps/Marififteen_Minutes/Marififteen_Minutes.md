**Game order is fixed: SMB3, SMW, SML2 and YI, in that order (sorted by release year)**

## Timing

The timing starts on Player 1 select in SMB3, and ends as the game finishes fading to black for the credits in YI

The console must be powered off for the next game until you finish the current game

Finishing the game means that a scene from the credits is fully visible, specifically: in SMB3, Mario must be present in Mushroom House w/peach in SMW, the black bars must finish drawing back to reveal the "Thank You!" scene in SML2 there's no fade-in time, just the castle must be visible

SGB1 is banned for SML2

All games start from new file

It is not necessary for run to be sub 15 to submit to leaderboard
